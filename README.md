# python_ireland_event_resources
This is an archive of the resources available for each Python Ireland event.

## How do I use this resource?

### Attendees: 
If you are an attendee and are interested in finding out more about a talk, you can find relevant information here.<br>
Here is a direct link to [PyCon 2025:](https://github.com/PythonIreland/python_ireland_event_resources/blob/main/pycons/2025/resources.csv)<br>
Here is a direct link to [PyCon 2024:](https://github.com/PythonIreland/python_ireland_event_resources/blob/main/pycons/2024/resources.csv)<br>

### Speakers: 
If you are a speaker you can add a list of relevant resources to the resources.csv in each "pycon" folder.<br>
The resources.csv files are located in this repo -> year -> resources.csv<br>
So: python_ireland_event_resources -> 2025 -> resources.csv

Useful resources could be; slides location, repo location, a video of this talk, your contact information.
For videos - you may have presented this talk at another conference, feel free to publish presentations previous of the same talk here. You may update the video link when the PyCon Ireland videos become available.

### For example:
If your talk details are:

Presenter name: "Paul Atreides"<br>
Presentation name: "The Butlerian Jihad - AI and it's impact."<br>
Presentation type: "keynote"<br>
Room number: 1<br>
Repo location: https://github.com/PythonIreland/python_ireland_event_resources<br>
Slides location: # None available, leave blank.<br>
Videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jepd7EVK-wA<br>
Contact: mywebsite.com/socials<br>

Then add them to the resources.csv like this:

| Presenter name: | Presentation name: | Presentation type: | Room number: | Repo location: | Slides location | videos: | contact |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "Paul Atreides" | "The Butlerian Jihad - AI and it's impact." | "keynote" | 1 | https://github.com/PythonIreland/python_ireland_event_resources | | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jepd7EVK-wA | mywebsite.com/socials |
